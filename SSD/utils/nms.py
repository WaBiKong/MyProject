def batched_nms(boxes, scores, idxs, iou_threshold):

    """
    Performs non-maximum suppression in a batched fashion.
    Each index value correspond to a category, and NMS
    will not be applied between elements of different categories.
    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4]
        boxes where NMS will be performed. They
        are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    idxs : Tensor[N]
        indices of the categories for each one of the boxes.
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping boxes
        with IoU < iou_threshold
    Returns
    -------
    keep : Tensor
        int64 tensor with the indices of
        the elements that have been kept by NMS, sorted
        in decreasing order of scores

    # strategy: in order to perform NMS independently per class.
    # we add an offset to all the boxes. The offset is dependent
    # only on the class idx, and is large enough so that boxes
    # from different classes do not overlap
    # 获取所有boxes中最大的坐标值（xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax）
    max_coordinate = boxes.max()

    # to(): Performs Tensor dtype and/or device conversion
    # 为每一个类别生成一个很大的偏移量
    # 这里的to只是让生成tensor的dytpe和device与boxes保持一致
    offsets = idxs.to(boxes) * (max_coordinate + 1)
    # boxes加上对应层的偏移量后，保证不同类别之间boxes不会有重合的现象

    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, float) -> Tensor
    """
    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).
    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than iou_threshold with another (higher scoring)
    box.
    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4])
        boxes to perform NMS on. They
        are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping
        boxes with IoU < iou_threshold
    Returns
    -------
